    My thesis was focused on evaluating so-called intelligence (AI) based algorithms for training some special kinds of oscillating networks (CPGs) had shown outstanding abilities for imitating repetitive movements specially walking of vertebrates, specially walking gaits. I used some setups to check that ability using simulation-based version of a humanoid robot made by Fujitsu.

    I was into digital signal processing (DSP) back in those times and tried to pursue my vision using a simple frequency analysis algorithm (FFT) for comparing frequency bands of some recorded inputs to thats of a pre-recorded commands containing mere numbers 1-9, in order to trigger some command in case one of them was detected.
