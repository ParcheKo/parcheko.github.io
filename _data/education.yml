    My thesis was focused on evaluating a some intelligence (AI) based algorithms for training some special kinds of oscillating networks (CPGs) which had shown outstanding abilities in imitating repetitive movements e.g. in walking of vertebrates, in my case for human walking gaits. I used some setups to check that ability using simulation-based version of a humanoid robot made by Fujitsu (HOAP-2).

    I was into digital signal processing (DSP) back in those times and tried to pursue my vision using a simple frequency analysis algorithm (FFT) for comparing frequency bands of some recorded inputs to those of a pre-recorded commands containing mere numbers 1-9, in order to trigger some command in case one of them is detected.
